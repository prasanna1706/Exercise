# 30 seconds of code

JavaScript snippets you can understand in 30 seconds or less.

## Setup & Usage

* Install this package from the [Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode).
* Make sure to add `"editor.snippetSuggestions": "top"` to your user settings to see these snippets on top in the suggestion popover.
* For the full list of snippets, please visit the [30 seconds of code repository](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code) or [website](https://30secondsofcode.org/).
* All snippets are prefixed with `30s_` (e.g. if you want to use the `all` snippet, you will write `30s_all`).

## Notes

* Some snippets might not yet be fully optimized for production. Remember to always test your code thoroughly to identify issues.
* Snippets are written in ES6 and use the fat arrow syntax. It is highly recommended to use the [Babel transpiler](https://babeljs.io/) to ensure backwards-compatibility.
